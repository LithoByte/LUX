  "description": "There's a bunch of really cool stuff in this pod, all targeted at letting you build the things that are *different* about your app, not the reproducing the same things over and over. Customizable, extendable, bare bones implementations of common UX components like splash, login, creds creation, commenting, and view/edit profile screens, an app delegate implementation that sets up fabric and crashlytics for you, a simple framework for handling user sessions, a material design based controller for table views... and more coming!",
